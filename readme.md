PROJECT 1

Team: Emmy Daro and Cynthia Jelke

This Project compares the theoretical period of five pendulums of different lengths based off of ideal formulas with the calculated
period of 5 real-world pendulums and a pendulum simulation.

Where to Access the Code and Files for Each Step:

  Step 2:
